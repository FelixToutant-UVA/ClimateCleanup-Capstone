Our python-files for the Capstone Project 

In the website folder, you'll find all the code for our web application. To run the site locally, simply open the main.py file and execute it. This will start a local server and provide you with a link to access the website in your browser.

Currently, the site includes login and sign-up functionality, allowing users to create an account and log in securely. In addition to authentication, weâ€™ve set up several content pages that will be gradually populated with data as the project develops.
